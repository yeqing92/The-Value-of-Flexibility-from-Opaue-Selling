This repo contains the code to generate numerical results in the E-companion, Appendix B. The experiment compares to stockout-based substitution.
- Use 2opq_substitution.py to generate results for 2 opaque selling strategy.
- Use nooq_substitution.py to generate results for n opaque selling strategy.

In this experiment, we use the same data file and parameters as the experiment in Table 3. Code that generates the data files can be found in the folder Table3.
