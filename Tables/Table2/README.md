This repo contains MATLAB code for Table 2 in the paper "The Value of Flexibility from Opaque Selling" comparing profitability of 2 opqaue selling and n opaque selling strategies.

The experiment for three different customer choice models can be found in folders "MNL", "Normal", and "Uniform", respectively. For each choice model, there is a file find_q.m to generate different choice probabilities.

The data files were generated using ER_c_q.m located in the folder "Uniform". The data files are "ER.mat", "ER2.mat", "ER_K.mat", "ER2_K.mat".
